This is an experimental version of the MiNTLib.  It is probably unstable
and contains a lot of bugs.  You are welcome to test it and send bug
reports (in fact, bug fixes are preferred) but please don't be to
harsh with criticism.  The authors are well aware of this release's
shortcomings.

Please don't overwrite your system libraries and system include
files, install in /usr/local.  Please don't distribute executables
build with this version unless you mark them too as being experimental.

If something is missing in the distribution it probably didn't get
lost.  It's more likely that I have forgotten it, sorry!
