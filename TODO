o includepath: Guido
  Makefile doesn't detect a new gcc version.  Fix: echo gcc version into
  stamp file and move-if-change.

o sunrpc/: Guido
  Install rpc database in /etc.

o Rewrite ctermid.c and cuserid.c.

o Missing reentrant functions (omitted for now because the corresponding
  source files should be re-written from the scratch, should be split up
  into distinct files for each function):

    int fgetgrent_r (FILE* stream, struct group* result_buf,
                     char* buffer, size_t buflen, struct group** result);
    int getgrgid_r (gid_t gid, struct group* result_buf,
                    char* buffer, size_t buflen, struct group** result);
    int getgrnam_r (const char* name, struct group* result_buf,
                    char* buffer, size_t buflen, struct group** result);
    int getlogin_r (you know what);

o Clean up all prototypes in the header files.  It is a bad idea to
  prototype like that:
  
    int foobar (int max, int min);
  
  Either do
  
    int foobar (int, int);
  
  or
  
    int foobar (int __max, int __min);
  
  Otherwise the argument identifiers run the risk of being expanded as
  eventually previously defined macros by the preprocessor.

o Get rid of include/support.h.  Any ideas where to move the prototypes?

o Problems with -mshort: Some I/O operations (notably read, write, fread
  and fwrite) take size_t (i. e. unsigned long) arguments for the buffer
  size and return int (i. e. short int with -mshort) as the result (bytes
  read resp. written).  There is no clean way to fix that.  Currently,
  for -mshort those prototypes have simply been changed so that they
  return long.  Any better ideas?

o exec* functions should be rewritten.  What about spawn?

o Avoid conflicts between <mint/dcntl.h> and <sys/ioctl.h>.

o Rewrite nlist.c to handle all binary formats.

o Implement i18n/l10n stuff from GNU libc.

o A lot of sysconf stuff still missing.
