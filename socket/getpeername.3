.SH DESCRIPTION
.I s
is a socket descriptor.
.I getpeername
returns the address of the peer socket connected to the socket indicated by
.IR s .
.I addr
points to a socket address structure in which this address is returned.
.I addrlen
points to an object of type
.BR size_t ,
which should be initialized to indicate the size of the address structure.
On return, it contains the actual size of the address returned (in bytes).
If
.I addr
does not point to enough space to contain the whole address of the peer,
only the first
.I addrlen
bytes of the address are returned.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the call is successful, 0 is returned.
If the call fails, \-1 is returned and an error code is stored in
.BR errno .
