The files in this directory are the source files to build the socket library
for MiNT.  It is based on the libsocket that was formerly included in
the MiNTNet package, which was originally written by Kay Roemer and then
later enhanced by Torsten Lang.

This is now included in libc and libsocket is deprecated.
