Version 0.55.3 - 07 May 2000

* Fixed st_blocks in stat() and friends.

* New and quicker qsort algorithm.

* Changed time_t to long int instead of int.

Version 0.55.2 - 10 April 2000

* Added forgotten include/bits/mint_stdio.h.

Version 0.55.1 - 09 April 2000

* Minor bugfixes.

* libc-symbols.h not installed any more.

* Missing functions added: llabs, strtoimax, strtoumax.

* argz functionality.

Version 0.55 - 02 April 2000

* Countless bugfixes.

* This version of the MiNTLib requires gcc 2.95.2, older gcc versions
  will not work, you can neither compile nor use the MiNTLib without
  them.  See README.1st for details.
  
* Introduction of a new stdio model, mostly taken from the GNU libc.
  The new stdio API is incompatible with previous releases.  See
  README.stdio to check if you have to recompile your binaries
  The new stdio model provides a lot of new features, see bits/mint_stdio.h
  for details.

* The data type long double has changed.  It now complies with 
  IEEE854, which will require recompilation of libraries or object 
  files that do long double arithmetics.  Accuracy problems with other 
  floating  point types have been solved.
  
* The source tree has been completely restructured.

* The MiNTLib now comes along with an exhaustive test suite.  Run
  "make -k check" in the compiled source tree to see the results.
  See README.tests for details.

* UFC (ultra-fast crypt) and support for MD5-crypt.  The new crypt()
  resp. fcrypt() routines outperform previous MiNTLib releases
  by factor 5 here.

* Incompatible change in select(): The function now internally calls
  poll().  The data type fd_set has changed and now has a theoratical
  limit of 1024 file descriptors.  Until the kernel gets changed you're
  still stuck with 32 descriptors though.  However, object files or
  libraries that reference select() have to get recompiled.

* This is the last MiNTLib that builds 16 bit integer libraries by
  default.  See README.mshort for details.

  In previous (unofficial) releases:
  
* The former portlib and the socketlib from the MiNTNet package have 
  been integrated into the MiNTLib.  

* The format of struct stat in <sys/stat.h> has changed in an 
  incompatible way -> recompile.

* Shadow password and group database.

* New management functions for utmp/wtmp.

* The library is now installed in /usr instead of /usr/local by
  default.
