This is a binary distribution of the MiNTLib.  A binary distribution 
should give you all you need for working with the MiNTLib.  

Please proceed with reading the file README (note that some of the
files mentioned there are not included in the binary distribution
because you don't need them).

The file INSTALL gives you installation instructions, both for
binary and source distributions.
