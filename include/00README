IMPORTANT!!!
============

The include directory has been restructured with version 0.50.1 (see NEWS).  
Make sure that you delete the following files from all your system include
directories:

cookie.h, dcntl.h, dir.h, file.h, ioctl.h, ssystem.h, param.h, stat.h, 
statfs.h, sys/restoresys, timeb.h, times.h, utsname.h.

Not deleting these files will result in unpredictable results when
compiling code with the new library.  If you install the library in
a normal way, the installation routine will remove these stale headers
for you.

If you are using gcc you maybe have to manually remove the following files
in case the installation routine fails to do so:

	float.h
	stdarg.h
	stddef.h
	varargs.h
	
In case you think you need these files: They have been renamed to
_float_h, _stdarg_h, _stddef_h and _varargs_h and can be found in the
subdirectory "include" of the MiNTLib distribution after you unpacked
it.  They are not needed if you use a recent gcc version, because
they belong to the compiler, not the libc.
